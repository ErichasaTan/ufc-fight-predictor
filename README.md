🥋 UFC Fight Predictor — Machine Learning Pipeline (UFCStats + Odds)

A full end-to-end machine learning project that predicts the winner of UFC fights using scraped UFCStats data, engineered fight features, and optional betting odds.
This project includes:

A custom data scraper for UFCStats (fighters, events, fights, and detailed striking/grappling metrics)

A feature engineering pipeline that transforms raw stats into predictive features

Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)

A future-fight prediction pipeline (in progress) that incorporates live betting odds

Clean project organization with reproducible notebooks and modular Python scripts

🚀 Project Goals

Build a reliable dataset of UFC fighter attributes, fight history, and event outcomes.

Engineer predictive features that capture physical differences, striking style, grappling efficiency, recent form, and more.

Train ML models to classify winners and evaluate which features matter most.

Scrape live odds for upcoming events and generate predictions for future fight cards.

Eventually: Deploy an interactive UI/API so anyone can select an event and view model predictions.
